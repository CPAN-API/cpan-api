# A Web Service for the CPAN

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/metacpan/metacpan-api.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/metacpan/metacpan-api)

MetaCPAN aims to provide a free, open web service which provides metadata for
CPAN modules.

## REST API

MetaCPAN is based on Elasticsearch, so it provides a RESTful interface as well
as the option to create complex queries. [The `docs/`
directory](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api/blob/master/docs/API-docs.md)
provides a good starting point for REST access to MetaCPAN.

## Expanding Your Author Info

MetaCPAN allows authors to add custom metadata about themselves to the index.
[Log in to MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/account/profile) to add more
information about yourself.

## Installing Your Own MetaCPAN

If you want to run MetaCPAN locally, we encourage you to start with
[metacpan-docker](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-docker). However, you
may still find some info here:

## Troubleshooting Elasticsearch

You can restart Elasticsearch (ES) manually if you need to troubleshoot.

```sh
sudo service elasticsearch restart
```

If you are unable to access [[http://localhost:9200]] (give it a few seconds)
you should kill the Elasticsearch process and run it in foreground to see the
debug output

```sh
sudo service elasticsearch stop
cd /opt/elasticsearch
sudo bin/elasticsearch -f
```

If you get a "Can't start up: not enough memory" error when trying to start
Elasticsearch, you likely need to update your JRE.  On Ubuntu:

```sh
# fixes "not enough memory" errors
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
```

(Note: If you intend to try indexing a full MiniCPAN, you may find that
Elasticsearch wants to use more open filehandles than your system allows by
default. [This script](https://gist.github.com/3230962) can be used to start ES
with the appropriate ulimit adjustment).

## Run the test suite

The test suite accesses Elasticsearch on port 9900. The developer VM should
have a dedicated test instance running in the background already, but if you
want to run it manually:

```sh
cd /opt/elasticsearch
sudo bin/elasticsearch -f -Des.http.port=9900 -Des.cluster.name=testing
```

Then run the test suite:

```sh
cd /home/metacpan/metacpan-api
./bin/prove t
```

The test suite has to pass all tests.

## Create the ElasticSearch Index

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan mapping --delete
```

`--delete` will drop all indices first to clear the index from test data.

## Begin Indexing Your Modules

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan release /path/to/cpan/authors/id/
```

You should note that you can index either your CPAN mirror or a minicpan
mirror.  You can even index just parts of a mirror:

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan release /path/to/cpan/authors/id/{A,B}
```

## Tag the Latest Releases

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan latest --cpan /path/to/cpan/
```

## Index Author Data

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan author --cpan /path/to/cpan/
```

Note that minicpan doesn't provide the 00whois.xml file which is used to
generate the index; you will have to download it manually (it is in the
authors/ directory) in order to index authors.

```bash
wget -O /path/to/cpan/authors/00whois.xml cpan.cpantesters.org/authors/00whois.xml
```

It also doesn't include author.json files, so that data will also be missing
unless you get it from somewhere else.

## Set Up Proxy in Front of ElasticSearch

Start API server on port 5000

```sh
./bin/run plackup -p 5000 -r
```

This will start a single-threaded test server. If you need extra performance,
use `Starman` instead.

## Notes

For a full list of options:

```sh
./bin/run bin/metacpan release --help
```
