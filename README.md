A Web Service for the CPAN
==========================

MetaCPAN aims to provide a free, open web service which provides metadata for
CPAN modules.

REST API
--------

MetaCPAN is based on ElasticSearch, so it provides a RESTful interface as well
as the option to create complex queries. [The
wiki](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/API-docs) provides a good
starting point for REST access to MetaCPAN.

Expanding Your Author Info
--------------------------

MetaCPAN allows authors to add custom metadata about themselves to the index.
[Log in to MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/account/profile) to add more
information about yourself.

Installing Your Own MetaCPAN:
---------------------------------------

See the [installation](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Installation)
page in the wiki to start playing with your own MetaCPAN installation.
